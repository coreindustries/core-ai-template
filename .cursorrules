# Cursor IDE Rules

This project uses AI agent-assisted development with Claude Code and Cursor IDE.

## Quick Reference

- **Main Instructions:** See `CLAUDE.md` for project guidance
- **Agent Patterns:** See `AGENTS.md` for AI agent quick reference
- **Rules:** See `.claude/rules/` for modular rules (Claude Code)
- **Tech Stack:** See `prd/02_Tech_stack.md` for technology decisions

## Code Standards

- **Type annotations** on all functions, attributes, and returns
- **Docstrings** on all public functions and classes
- **DRY principle** - search for existing implementations first
- **Modern syntax** for your language version
- **Test coverage** minimum as defined in tech stack (typically 66-100%)

## AI Agent Principles

- **Autonomy:** Complete tasks end-to-end, don't stop at plans
- **Persistence:** Continue until working code is delivered
- **Correctness:** Prioritize correctness over speed
- **Comprehensiveness:** Update all relevant surfaces

## Quality Checks

Run quality checks every 15-30 minutes during development:
- Lint and format
- Type check
- Run tests
- Security scan (before commits)

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commit format: `<type>: <description>`
- Never revert changes you didn't make
- Preserve existing changes in dirty worktrees
- Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude` in commits

## Security

- Never hardcode secrets (use environment variables)
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement audit logging for security events
- See `.claude/rules/security.md` for full security standards
